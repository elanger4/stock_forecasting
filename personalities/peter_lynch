# Peter Lynch Investment Strategy Guide

## Overview
Peter Lynch is one of the most successful mutual fund managers in history, running Fidelity's Magellan Fund from 1977-1990 and achieving an astounding 29.2% annual return - more than double the S&P 500. What makes Lynch special is his **accessibility**: unlike most investment legends, his approach is designed for everyday investors. His philosophy centers on "invest in what you know," finding simple businesses before Wall Street discovers them, and using common sense over complex financial models.

## Core Investment Philosophy

**Know What You Own + Simple Businesses + Long-Term Patience = Tenbaggers**

Lynch's approach is built on:
1. Your everyday experiences give you investment edge over professionals
2. Simple businesses you can explain to a child are best
3. Look for companies in boring, unsexy industries (less competition from analysts)
4. A few big winners (10-baggers, 20-baggers) will make your portfolio
5. You don't need to be right about everything - just don't lose big on your losers
6. The stock market will always recover from downturns given enough time

## The Six Categories of Stocks

Lynch categorizes every stock into one of six types. Each requires different analysis and has different risk/reward profiles:

### 1. Slow Growers
**Definition:** Large, mature companies growing slightly faster than GDP

**Examples:** Utilities, old-line manufacturers, Coca-Cola (in mature phase)

**Characteristics:**
- Revenue growth: 2-4% annually
- Pay substantial dividends (4-6%+)
- Very stable, boring businesses
- Minimal growth potential

**When to Buy:** Never, unless dividend yield is exceptional
**When to Sell:** When dividend is cut or business deteriorates

**Lynch's View:** "Slow growers are usually in mature industries. I avoid them."

```python
def is_slow_grower(ticker_info):
    """
    Identify slow grower characteristics
    """
    revenue_growth = ticker_info.get('revenueGrowth', 0)
    dividend_yield = ticker_info.get('dividendYield', 0)
    market_cap = ticker_info.get('marketCap', 0)
    
    is_slow = (
        revenue_growth < 0.06 and           # Less than 6% growth
        market_cap > 50_000_000_000 and     # Very large cap ($50B+)
        dividend_yield > 0.03               # 3%+ dividend
    )
    
    return is_slow

# Example
# AT&T, Verizon, Duke Energy = Slow Growers
```

### 2. Stalwarts
**Definition:** Large companies growing 10-12% annually, household names

**Examples:** Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart

**Characteristics:**
- Revenue growth: 10-12% annually
- Market cap: $10B+
- Defensive, consistent earnings
- Won't make you rich quickly but won't lose you money

**When to Buy:** When price dips 30-40% below normal valuation
**When to Sell:** When price rises 30-50% above your purchase, or P/E gets too high
**Expected Return:** 30-50% over 2-3 years, then sell and rotate

**Lynch's View:** "Stalwarts are good for protection during recessions and for 30-50% gains. I keep 10-20% of portfolio in stalwarts."

```python
def is_stalwart(ticker_info):
    """
    Identify stalwart characteristics
    """
    revenue_growth = ticker_info.get('revenueGrowth', 0)
    market_cap = ticker_info.get('marketCap', 0)
    roe = ticker_info.get('returnOnEquity', 0)
    
    is_stalwart = (
        0.08 <= revenue_growth <= 0.15 and  # 8-15% growth
        market_cap > 10_000_000_000 and     # Large cap ($10B+)
        roe > 0.15                          # Strong ROE
    )
    
    return is_stalwart

# Examples: KO, PG, JNJ, WMT, HD, MCD
```

### 3. Fast Growers (Lynch's Favorite!)
**Definition:** Small, aggressive companies growing 20-25%+ annually

**Examples:** Dunkin' Donuts (when Lynch bought), Taco Bell, The Limited, Pier 1 (in their growth phases)

**Characteristics:**
- Revenue growth: 20-50% annually
- Market cap: Typically under $5B when Lynch buys
- Expanding rapidly (new stores, new markets, new products)
- Haven't yet saturated their market

**When to Buy:** Early in growth phase, before Wall Street discovers them
**When to Sell:** When growth slows, story changes, or stock gets absurdly expensive
**Expected Return:** Multi-baggers (10x+) if you catch them early

**Lynch's View:** "This is where the tenbaggers come from. I'd put 30-40% of my portfolio in fast growers."

```python
def is_fast_grower(ticker_info):
    """
    Identify fast grower characteristics
    
    These are Lynch's favorites - potential 10-baggers
    """
    revenue_growth = ticker_info.get('revenueGrowth', 0)
    earnings_growth = ticker_info.get('earningsGrowth', 0)
    market_cap = ticker_info.get('marketCap', 0)
    debt_to_equity = ticker_info.get('debtToEquity', 0)
    
    is_fast = (
        revenue_growth > 0.20 and           # 20%+ revenue growth
        earnings_growth > 0.20 and          # 20%+ earnings growth
        market_cap < 5_000_000_000 and      # Under $5B (room to grow)
        debt_to_equity < 0.50               # Not overleveraged
    )
    
    # Additional check: Is there still runway?
    # This requires qualitative analysis of market saturation
    
    return is_fast

# Modern examples might be: 
# - Regional restaurant chains before national expansion
# - Software companies in growing niches
# - Retail concepts in early expansion phase
```

**The Fast Grower Checklist:**
```python
fast_grower_questions = [
    "Can the company replicate its success in new markets?",
    "What's the total addressable market?",
    "How saturated is current market penetration?",
    "Are unit economics working? (Each new store profitable)",
    "Is growth sustainable or just a fad?",
    "Does management have track record of execution?",
    "Can they maintain quality during rapid expansion?",
    "What could stop the growth? (Competition, saturation, execution)"
]

# If you can't answer these confidently, don't buy
```

### 4. Cyclicals
**Definition:** Companies whose fortunes rise and fall with economic cycles

**Examples:** Auto manufacturers, airlines, steel, chemicals, housing, commodities

**Characteristics:**
- Boom and bust earnings patterns
- Very sensitive to economic cycle
- Can look "cheap" (low P/E) at exact wrong time (peak earnings)
- Can look "expensive" (high P/E) at exact right time (trough earnings)

**When to Buy:** Early in economic recovery, when everyone hates them
**When to Sell:** When recovery is obvious to everyone, business is booming
**Key Mistake:** Buying because P/E looks low (it's low because earnings are about to collapse!)

**Lynch's View:** "Cyclicals are the most dangerous. You must buy them at the right time (early recovery) and sell at the right time (late expansion). Most investors do the opposite."

```python
def is_cyclical(ticker_info, ticker_symbol):
    """
    Identify cyclical stocks
    
    These are DANGEROUS if you don't time them right
    """
    sector = ticker_info.get('sector')
    industry = ticker_info.get('industry')
    
    cyclical_sectors = [
        'Basic Materials',
        'Industrials',
        'Consumer Cyclical',
        'Energy'
    ]
    
    cyclical_industries = [
        'Auto Manufacturers',
        'Airlines',
        'Steel',
        'Chemicals',
        'Homebuilding',
        'Hotels',
        'Paper & Forest Products'
    ]
    
    is_cyclical = (
        sector in cyclical_sectors or
        industry in cyclical_industries
    )
    
    return is_cyclical

# Examples: F (Ford), AAL (American Airlines), NUE (Nucor), 
#           DHI (DR Horton), LEN (Lennar)
```

**The Cyclical Trap:**
```python
# WRONG approach to cyclicals:
def bad_cyclical_analysis():
    """
    What NOT to do with cyclicals
    """
    # Year 2006 (housing boom peak):
    homebuilder = {
        'ticker': 'DHI',
        'earnings': 10.00,      # Peak earnings
        'price': 60,
        'pe_ratio': 6.0         # Looks cheap!
    }
    
    # Investor thinks: "P/E of 6! What a bargain!"
    # Investor buys...
    
    # Year 2008 (housing bust):
    homebuilder_later = {
        'ticker': 'DHI',
        'earnings': -5.00,      # Losses!
        'price': 10,            # Stock down 83%
        'pe_ratio': 'N/A'       # Negative earnings
    }
    
    # This is the cyclical trap!

# RIGHT approach to cyclicals:
def good_cyclical_analysis():
    """
    How to analyze cyclicals properly
    """
    # Look at:
    # 1. Where are we in the economic cycle?
    # 2. What's inventory situation? (High inventory = trouble ahead)
    # 3. Are factories running at capacity? (Peak capacity = peak earnings)
    # 4. What's management saying about future demand?
    # 5. Price-to-book (better metric than P/E for cyclicals)
    
    # Buy when: Industry is depressed, inventories low, P/B below 1.0
    # Sell when: Industry booming, inventories rising, P/B above 2.0
```

### 5. Turnarounds
**Definition:** Companies in trouble that are restructuring, cutting costs, selling assets

**Examples:** Chrysler (1980s), Apple (late 1990s), companies in bankruptcy

**Characteristics:**
- Recent operational or financial troubles
- New management or new strategy
- Cost-cutting initiatives
- Asset sales or restructuring
- Negative sentiment

**When to Buy:** After worst is over, signs of stabilization appear
**When to Sell:** When turnaround is complete and priced in
**Risk Level:** HIGH - many turnarounds fail

**Lynch's View:** "Turnarounds can be profitable, but you need to understand why the company got in trouble and whether the fix is working. I prefer to wait for evidence of recovery."

```python
def is_turnaround(ticker_info, ticker_symbol):
    """
    Identify potential turnarounds
    
    High risk, high reward if successful
    """
    import yfinance as yf
    
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info
    financials = ticker.financials
    
    # Signs of turnaround situation:
    turnaround_signals = []
    
    # 1. Recent losses or declining revenue
    try:
        recent_net_income = financials.loc['Net Income'].iloc[0]
        prev_net_income = financials.loc['Net Income'].iloc[1]
        
        if recent_net_income < 0 or recent_net_income < prev_net_income * 0.5:
            turnaround_signals.append("Recent earnings trouble")
    except:
        pass
    
    # 2. High debt load
    debt_to_equity = info.get('debtToEquity', 0)
    if debt_to_equity > 1.5:
        turnaround_signals.append("High debt burden")
    
    # 3. Stock down significantly from highs
    current_price = info.get('currentPrice', 0)
    fifty_two_high = info.get('fiftyTwoWeekHigh', 1)
    if current_price < fifty_two_high * 0.5:
        turnaround_signals.append("Down 50%+ from highs")
    
    # 4. New management (would need to check manually)
    # 5. Asset sales or restructuring (need news research)
    
    is_turnaround = len(turnaround_signals) >= 2
    
    return is_turnaround, turnaround_signals

# Examples: Companies coming out of bankruptcy, 
#           businesses with new CEOs fixing operations
```

**Turnaround Checklist:**
```python
turnaround_questions = [
    "What went wrong? Is it fixable?",
    "Is the problem industry-wide (bad) or company-specific (good)?",
    "Is there a new, capable management team?",
    "Are they cutting costs effectively?",
    "Is cash flow improving?",
    "Can they survive long enough for turnaround to work?",
    "What's the bankruptcy risk?",
    "Are there any green shoots? (small signs of improvement)"
]

# Only invest in turnarounds if you see concrete evidence of improvement
```

### 6. Asset Plays
**Definition:** Companies with valuable hidden assets not reflected in stock price

**Examples:** Companies with real estate, natural resources, patents, tax loss carryforwards

**Characteristics:**
- Book value significantly understates true asset value
- Market doesn't recognize hidden assets
- Often boring, unloved companies
- Could be liquidated for more than stock price

**When to Buy:** When you can value the assets and they're worth much more than market cap
**When to Sell:** When assets are recognized/monetized or when near asset value
**Risk Level:** LOW to MEDIUM (assets provide downside protection)

**Lynch's View:** "Asset plays are safe bets. Even if the business struggles, the assets have value. Look for companies trading below net-net working capital or with valuable real estate."

```python
def is_asset_play(ticker_symbol):
    """
    Identify potential asset plays
    
    These provide margin of safety through hard assets
    """
    import yfinance as yf
    
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)

    # 2. Significant cash relative to market cap
    total_cash = info.get('totalCash', 0)
    if total_cash > market_cap * 0.5:
        asset_play_signals.append(f"Cash = {total_cash/market_cap:.1%} of market cap")
    
    # 3. Real estate or natural resources
    try:
        ppe = balance_sheet.loc['Net PPE'].iloc[0]  # Property, plant, equipment
        if ppe > market_cap:
            asset_play_signals.append("PPE exceeds market cap")
    except:
        pass
    
    # 4. Net-net working capital (Graham's metric)
    try:
        current_assets = balance_sheet.loc['Current Assets'].iloc[0]
        total_liabilities = balance_sheet.loc['Total Liabilities Net Minority Interest'].iloc[0]
        
        net_net = current_assets - total_liabilities
        if net_net > market_cap:
            asset_play_signals.append("Net-net working capital > market cap!")
    except:
        pass
    
    is_asset = len(asset_play_signals) >= 1
    
    return is_asset, asset_play_signals

# Examples: Companies with valuable real estate (retail chains owning their properties),
#           Mining companies with proven reserves,
#           Companies with valuable patents or brand names
```

## Lynch's Key Metrics & Analysis

### 1. The P/E Ratio (Most Important!)

Lynch is famous for the **PEG Ratio** (P/E to Growth ratio):

```python
def calculate_peg_ratio(ticker_symbol):
    """
    Lynch's favorite metric: PEG Ratio
    
    PEG = P/E Ratio / Growth Rate
    
    Rules:
    - PEG < 0.5 = Very attractive
    - PEG < 1.0 = Fairly valued
    - PEG > 1.5 = Expensive
    - PEG > 2.0 = Very expensive
    """
    import yfinance as yf
    
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info
    
    # Get P/E ratio
    pe_ratio = info.get('trailingPE') or info.get('forwardPE')
    
    # Get growth rate (use earnings growth)
    growth_rate = info.get('earningsGrowth', 0) * 100  # Convert to percentage
    
    if not pe_ratio or not growth_rate or growth_rate <= 0:
        return None, "Insufficient data for PEG calculation"
    
    # Calculate PEG
    peg = pe_ratio / growth_rate
    
    # Lynch's interpretation
    if peg < 0.5:
        interpretation = "VERY ATTRACTIVE - Potentially undervalued"
    elif peg < 1.0:
        interpretation = "FAIR VALUE - Reasonable price for growth"
    elif peg < 1.5:
        interpretation = "SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE - Proceed with caution"
    elif peg < 2.0:
        interpretation = "EXPENSIVE - Growth already priced in"
    else:
        interpretation = "VERY EXPENSIVE - Avoid unless exceptional story"
    
    print(f"\n{info.get('longName')} ({ticker_symbol})")
    print(f"P/E Ratio: {pe_ratio:.2f}")
    print(f"Growth Rate: {growth_rate:.1f}%")
    print(f"PEG Ratio: {peg:.2f}")
    print(f"Assessment: {interpretation}")
    
    return peg, interpretation

# Example
calculate_peg_ratio('AAPL')
```

**Lynch's PEG Rule:**
- **PEG < 1.0:** Stock is cheaper than its growth rate suggests (good buy)
- **PEG = 1.0:** Fair value (growth equals P/E)
- **PEG > 1.5:** Overvalued (paying too much for growth)

**Important caveat:** Only works for fast growers and stalwarts, NOT for cyclicals or turnarounds!

### 2. The Two-Minute Drill

Lynch's famous "elevator pitch" test - can you explain why you own a stock in two minutes?

```python
def two_minute_drill(ticker_symbol):
    """
    Lynch's test: Can you explain your investment thesis simply?
    
    You should be able to answer these in 2 minutes:
    """
    questions = [
        "What does the company do? (one sentence)",
        "Why will it be successful? (specific reason)",
        "What needs to happen for stock to go up?",
        "What could go wrong?",
        "What category is it? (fast grower, stalwart, etc.)",
        "What's the story in one paragraph?"
    ]
    
    print(f"\nTWO-MINUTE DRILL: {ticker_symbol}")
    print("="*60)
    print("Can you answer these questions clearly and simply?\n")
    
    for i, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {question}")
    
    print("\nIf you can't answer these, you don't understand the business!")
    print("Lynch: 'Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon.'")

# If you can't do this drill, don't buy the stock!
```

### 3. The Story

Lynch emphasizes understanding the **narrative** behind a stock:

## The "Lynch Stalwarts" Strategy

```python

    """
    Lynch's approach to stalwarts: Buy low, sell high within range
    
    Example: Coca-Cola historically trades between P/E of 15-25
    - Buy when P/E drops to 15-17 (market overreacts to bad news)
    - Sell when P/E rises to 23-25 (market overexcited)
    - Target: 30-50% gain, then rotate to next stalwart

## Conclusion

Peter Lynch's investment philosophy is the most **accessible and practical** for individual investors. Unlike institutional investors who can't buy small caps or need complex models, retail investors can:

**Key Advantages:**
- Use everyday observations as research (the mall, workplace, home)
- Buy small companies before Wall Street discovers them
- Move quickly without regulatory constraints
- Invest in what you understand deeply

**Core Insights:**
1. **Simple is better** - Understand the business a child could explain
2. **Categories matter** - Different stock types require different analysis
3. **PEG ratio** - Best single metric for fast growers (P/E ÷ Growth)
4. **Big winners matter** - A few 10-baggers beat many singles
5. **Story is everything** - If story intact, ignore price fluctuations

**Best for investors who:**
- Want to use common sense over complex math
- Can research companies in daily life
- Have patience for 3-5+ year holding periods
- Want to understand what they own
- Can handle volatility if thesis intact

**The Lynch Promise:** You don't need to be a genius, work on Wall Street, or have an MBA. You just need to pay attention to the world around you, do basic homework on companies, and have the patience to let great businesses compound.

The average investor's advantage: **You can wait. You can start small. You can learn from mistakes. And you only need a few great investments to build wealth.**

Would you like me to analyze specific stocks using Lynch's methodology, or create guides for other legendary investors?
