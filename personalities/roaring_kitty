Roaring Kitty Investment Strategy Guide
Overview
Keith Gill (aka Roaring Kitty/DeepFuckingValue) employed a contrarian value investing approach that combined traditional fundamental analysis with technical setup recognition, particularly around short squeeze dynamics. His strategy focused on finding deeply undervalued companies with strong balance sheets, operational turnaround potential, and extreme bearish sentiment that created asymmetric risk/reward opportunities.
Core Investment Philosophy
Value + Catalyst + Controversy = Opportunity
Roaring Kitty looked for situations where:

Fundamental value was significantly higher than market price
Clear catalysts existed for value realization
Consensus was overwhelmingly negative (creating the mispricing)
Technical setup (high short interest) provided additional upside potential

Key Metrics & Screening Criteria
1. Valuation Metrics (Primary Focus)
Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)

Target: P/B < 1.0 (ideally well below)
Philosophy: Company trading below liquidation value suggests extreme pessimism
yfinance field: info['priceToBook']

Market Cap vs. Net Cash

Target: Market cap < (Cash - Total Debt)
Philosophy: If you can buy the company for less than its net cash, everything else is "free"
yfinance calculation:

python  market_cap = info['marketCap']
  total_cash = info['totalCash']
  total_debt = info['totalDebt']
  net_cash = total_cash - total_debt
  trading_below_net_cash = market_cap < net_cash
Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Target: Positive and growing FCF, high FCF yield
Philosophy: Cash generation is real value; accounting profits can be manipulated
yfinance fields:

python  fcf = info['freeCashflow']
  operating_cashflow = info['operatingCashflow']
  # FCF Yield
  fcf_yield = fcf / info['marketCap'] if fcf and info.get('marketCap') else None
Enterprise Value Ratios

Target: EV/EBITDA < 5-8, EV/FCF < 10-15
Philosophy: Looking for companies trading at distressed valuations
yfinance fields:

python  enterprise_value = info['enterpriseValue']
  ebitda = info['ebitda']
  ev_to_ebitda = info['enterpriseToEbitda']
  ev_to_revenue = info['enterpriseToRevenue']
2. Balance Sheet Strength
Current Ratio

Target: > 1.5 (preferably > 2.0)
Philosophy: Company can weather short-term difficulties
yfinance calculation:

python  balance_sheet = ticker.balance_sheet
  current_assets = balance_sheet.loc['Current Assets'].iloc[0]
  current_liabilities = balance_sheet.loc['Current Liabilities'].iloc[0]
  current_ratio = current_assets / current_liabilities
Debt-to-Equity

Target: < 0.5 (lower is better)
Philosophy: Low debt = flexibility and survival capability
yfinance field: info['debtToEquity']

Cash Position

Target: High cash relative to market cap
yfinance fields:

python  total_cash = info['totalCash']
  cash_per_share = info['totalCash'] / info['sharesOutstanding']
3. Short Interest Metrics (Critical for RK Strategy)
Short Interest as % of Float

Target: > 20% is high, > 40% is extreme, > 100% is unicorn territory
Philosophy: High short interest = fuel for potential squeeze + validation of extreme pessimism
yfinance fields:

python  shares_short = info['sharesShort']
  float_shares = info['floatShares']
  short_percent_float = info['shortPercentOfFloat']  # Pre-calculated (decimal)
  # Manual calculation
  short_pct = (shares_short / float_shares) * 100 if float_shares else None
Short Ratio (Days to Cover)

Target: > 5 days suggests squeeze potential
Philosophy: How many days of average volume needed to cover all shorts
yfinance field: info['shortRatio']

Short Interest Trend

Target: Rising short interest while fundamentals improve
Philosophy: Shorts getting more aggressive as they're proven wrong = powder keg
yfinance: Track sharesShort over time using historical data or news

4. Operational & Turnaround Indicators
Revenue Trends

Target: Stable or growing, not collapsing
yfinance:

python  financials = ticker.financials
  revenue = financials.loc['Total Revenue']
  # Compare YoY growth
Insider Ownership

Target: Meaningful insider buying, especially by activists
yfinance field: info['heldPercentInsiders']

Institutional Ownership

Target: Monitor for activist investors or value-focused institutions
yfinance:

python  institutional_holders = ticker.institutional_holders
  major_holders = ticker.major_holders
5. Sentiment & Positioning
Analyst Recommendations

Target: Predominantly "sell" or "hold" ratings
Philosophy: Maximum pessimism = maximum opportunity
yfinance:

python  recommendations = ticker.recommendations
  # Count sell vs buy ratings
52-Week Range

Target: Trading near 52-week lows
yfinance fields:

python  current_price = info['currentPrice']
  fifty_two_week_low = info['fiftyTwoWeekLow']
  fifty_two_week_high = info['fiftyTwoWeekHigh']
  pct_off_high = (fifty_two_week_high - current_price) / fifty_two_week_high

Screening Algorithm
Here's a suggested screening workflow:
Step 1: Initial Filter (Cast Wide Net)
python# Valuation screens
- P/B < 1.5
- Market cap < $5B (focus on overlooked companies)
- Positive free cash flow
- Current ratio > 1.5

# Short interest screen
- Short % of float > 15%
Step 2: Deep Value Filter
python# Look for extreme value
- P/B < 1.0 OR Market cap < Net cash OR FCF yield > 15%
- Debt-to-equity < 0.5
- Not in bankruptcy or imminent distress
Step 3: Short Squeeze Setup
python# Identify technical potential
- Short % of float > 30%
- Short ratio > 5 days
- Increasing short interest trend
Step 4: Catalyst Identification
python# Look for turnaround signals (manual research)
- New management or activist investors
- Asset sales or restructuring
- New product cycles or strategic shifts
- Industry tailwinds
Step 5: Sentiment Confirmation
python# Validate extreme pessimism
- Stock near 52-week lows
- Predominantly negative analyst ratings
- Declining institutional ownership (selling has been exhausted)
Risk Management (RK Style)
Position Sizing

Start small, add on confirmation
Use options for leverage with defined risk
Long-dated calls (6+ months) for asymmetric payoff

Entry Strategy

Build position over time as thesis develops
Look for capitulation volume spikes (maximum fear)
Average down if fundamentals improve but price falls

Exit Strategy

Set upside targets based on normalized valuation
Trail stops once in profit
Take partial profits on spikes, hold core for full revaluation

Key Differences from Traditional Value Investing

Emphasis on short interest - Traditional value investors ignore this; RK saw it as both validation and catalyst
Options for leverage - Used long-dated calls rather than just shares
Comfort with controversy - Actively sought stocks that were hated and mocked
Technical awareness - Combined fundamental value with understanding of forced buying dynamics
Patience with volatility - Willing to hold through extreme swings if thesis intact

Red Flags to Avoid
Even with RK's approach, avoid:

Terminal decline businesses - Value traps with no path forward (e.g., dying malls)
Fraud or accounting issues - Balance sheet value doesn't matter if it's fake
Imminent bankruptcy - Short sellers might be right about survival risk
Dilution risk - Companies that constantly issue shares destroy value
No catalyst visible - Value without a catalyst can stay cheap forever

Conclusion
Roaring Kitty's strategy was sophisticated contrarian value investing that recognized short squeezes as both a validation signal and a technical catalyst. The key is finding genuine value + extreme pessimism + technical setup, then having conviction to hold through volatility when others panic.
